                        <div class="bubble bubble-bottom-left" contenteditable>Hello Everyone Reading... I wanted to wish all of the teachers across the globe a happy teacher's day. Noting would be possible without teachers. The next generation of doctors, rocket scientists, engineers, and bankers originate with teachers. Like Christina ma'am who's always there for us, and Sima ma'am who will not let us fail by putting so much effort into creating and uploading all the content. Rishi sir, who helped me in English. It was the one subject I was weak in but now I think I might just get better marks (in terms) in English than in other subjects now! There is Akshay sir, who is ready to help me anytime I need help. I remember before the physics term exam I bugged him so much with doubts! Sanjay sir, the teacher of one of my favorite subjects. Economics. I find Economics really interesting and Sanjay sir somehow manages to manipulate that interest 10 times more by always keeping the classes so fun and informative! Sarla ma'am, who makes a dry subject like math truly enjoyable and still helps us ace our tests. Math classes are definitely something I look forward to now! If a person would ask, who would be your favorite teacher? I would be speechless because in my eye all the teachers are my favorite. I could go on and on but I am coming to an end here.  Lots of gratitude - Diya Joshi</div>

It was because of the teacher that it's been so easy for me to adjust into the new school. I actually have been a shy child since a long time , but this year it was much better, I was talking to people with no worries. I think that's because of how incredibly the teachers and the principal have shaped the surroundings and the students. I would like to wish all the teachers a Wonderful Teachers Day!!! - Riddhi</div>
